### Backend Logic ###

#1. Admin is the one that registers a user after screening and after the event. 
#2. Admin has a default entry in the database, which he/she can change from the database, 
#3. The student then navigates to the sign in where there is an option to forget password, then reset the password based
on default details in the database, then update the profile. 

All can apply for events, even when not registered in the database, apply events by id,
then the applicants are vetted and then the ones that make it are shortlisted and a lis is generated. 
The students after the event, the ideas that are approved now are entered into the system by the admin. 

so.....
Apply event => screening => attend event => if approved and pass then => Admin creates the student profile 
   => assign alo the role and stage by default => sudent navigates to login then resets credentils to login => 
   updates the profile and track the progress
